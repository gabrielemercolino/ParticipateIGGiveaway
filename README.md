# ParticipateIGGiveaway

Collection of scripts for automatically participate on Instant Gaming giveaways

# Installation

First you need to install either [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) depending on your browser.

Then you can click [here](https://github.com/gabrielemercolino/ParticipateIGGiveaway/raw/main/participate.user.js) to install the script for auto-participating and [here](https://github.com/gabrielemercolino/ParticipateIGGiveaway/raw/main/open_giveaways.user.js) to install the script for auto-opening all giveaways.

# Usage

Just click the newly created button "Open all giveaways" in the extension menÃ¹ and watch it do the work.

If you just installed the first script you can click on the links and it will still click the participate button.

> [!note]
> It ***should*** work even if your connection is slow
> 
> If you encounter issues and you need to stop the auto-opening you can close the browser.

# Info

- The first script (`participate.user.js`) automatically clicks the button and no further interaction is required.
- The second script (`open_giveaways.user.js`) creates instead a button that you need to click for the pages to open. Specifically opens a page, waits 2 seconds and then closes it to prevent spamming and blocking from the site itself.
