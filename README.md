# Usage

Just click the newly created button "Open giveaways" in the extension menÃ¹ and watch it do the work.

If you just installed the first script you can click on the links and it will still click the participate button.

> [!note]
> It ***should*** work even if your connection is slow
> 
> If you encounter issues and you need to stop the auto-opening you can close the browser.

# Info

- The script (`giveaways.user.js`) creates a button that you need to click for the pages to open. Specifically opens a page, searches the participate button and clicks it if it exists. Also shows at the end some statistics.
