# ParticipateIGGiveaway

Collection of scripts for automatically participate on Instant Gaming giveaways

# Installation

First you need to install either [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) depending on your browser.

Then you can click [here](https://github.com/gabrielemercolino/ParticipateIGGiveaway/raw/main/participate.user.js) to install the script for auto-participating and [here](https://github.com/gabrielemercolino/ParticipateIGGiveaway/raw/main/open_giveaways.user.js) to install the script for auto-opening all giveaways.

# Usage

- The first script (`participate.user.js`) automatically clicks the button and no further interaction is required. Specifically it clicks the button, waits a second to ensure the action is registered and reloads the page so you can see if it actually worked
- The second script (`open_giveaways.user.js`) creates instead a button that you need to click for the pages to open. Specifically opens a page every 2 seconds to prevent spamming and blocking from the site itself

You can install even just one of them, however they are inteded to be used together
