Script for automatically participate on Instant Gaming giveaways

## Installation

First you need to install either [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) depending on your browser.

Then you can go to the [latest release](https://github.com/gabrielemercolino/ParticipateIGGiveaway/releases/latest) and click on the file named `giveaways.user.js` and the extension should pick it up

## Usage

Go to [instant gaming](https://www.instant-gaming.com), log-in if necessary and just click the newly created button `"Open giveaways"` in the extension menÃ¹ and watch it do the work.

Other buttons with `"[DEBUG]"` can be used but are actually just used for development and can be ignored.

> [!note]
> It **_should_** work even if your connection is slow
>
> If you encounter issues and you need to stop the auto-opening you can close the browser.

## Updating

If you installed the script after `3.0.0` the extension should be able to update the script by itself.

In any case you can go to the [latest release](https://github.com/gabrielemercolino/ParticipateIGGiveaway/releases/latest) (or any of the [releases](https://github.com/gabrielemercolino/ParticipateIGGiveaway/releases)) and follow the installation process, the extension should ask if you want to upgrade it.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute, for example to add more giveaways, you can fork the repo, do whatever you want to do and open a pr against the `dev` branch.

Even if you are a collaborator you have to open pr(s) against `dev`.
